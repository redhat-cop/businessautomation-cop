= KIE Spring Boot XA App

An example of a KIE Spring Boot app, demonstrating XA transactions between an external data source and jBPM.

Available Spring Profiles:
- Default (H2 in-memory),
- Dev(H2 file based),
- MySQL (TODO),
- ProstgreSQL (TODO)

Run the example with a profile:

----
$ mvn spring-boot:run (Default profile)
----

or 

----
$ mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=<PROFILE>
----

### Use Cases
Please review the test class ```com.redhat.services.test.process.SampleProcessTest.java``` for the various usage examples

This project includes 2 datasources, 1 for jBPM to persist its context/session data to and an
additional datasource for application purposes. This example doesn't demonstrate best practice or
provide insight on whether XA's should be used etc.. The external database is used in two different ways:

- Embedded as part of a Listener (ProcessEvent - ```com.redhat.services.listener.ProcessEventListener.java``` ) implementation
- Outside of jBPM, controlled as part of a service class orchestrating calls: ```com.redhat.services.component.XATransactions.java```

### Tests

`com.redhat.services.test.process.SampleProcessTest.java` contains a number of scenarios:

1. Persistence via Listener (Happy Path)
- Creates new jBPM Instances
- Listener persists new record into database
- Records successfully persisted to both datasources

2. Persistence via Listener (Exception Path - Listener Fails)
- Creates new jBPM Instances
- Listener persists new record into database
- Exception thrown from Listener
- Everything Rolls Back

3. Persistence via Parent Orchestrating Method (Happy Path)
- Spring Repository creates new
- Creates new jBPM Instances
- Records successfully persisted to both datasources

4. Persistence via Parent Orchestrating Method Spring Repo First (Exception Path )
- Spring Repository creates new
- Creates new jBPM Instances
- Exception thrown from Orchestrating method
- Everything Rolls Back

5. Persistence via Parent Orchestrating Method jBPM First (Exception Path )
- Creates new jBPM Instances
- Spring Repository creates new
- Exception thrown from Orchestrating method
- Everything Rolls Back

6. Persistence via Parent Orchestrating Method jBPM First (Exception Path : Listener Fails )
- Spring Repository creates new
- Creates new jBPM Instances
- Listener persists new record into database
- Exception thrown from Listener
- Everything Rolls Back
